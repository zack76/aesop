### **Notes:**

The endpoint of this project(the endpoint) has been blocked due to CORS policy, which means the server might need to set a header to solve this issue.
The whole project is built base on the data from Postman using the same endpoint, and cors-anywhere (forbidden sometimes).



#####Error Message:

Access to fetch at 'endpoint' from origin 'http://localhost:3000' has been blocked by CORS policy: Response to preflight request doesn't pass access control check: No 'Access-Control-Allow-Origin' header is present on the requested resource.
